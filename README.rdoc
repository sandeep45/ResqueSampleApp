== Sample Resque App

This app uses Resque (w/Redis), unicorn (w/multiple child processes), rails and
works on Heroku!

I also have aws included.

AWS.config({
  :access_key_id => ENV['ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
  :secret_access_key => ENV['SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
})

s3 = AWS::S3.new

s3.buckets.each { |x| puts x.name }
  cookie_monster_dev
  fk_dev
  sandeep45_dev
  sandeep45_expirement
  sandeep45_prod
